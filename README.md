# Description

Information Retrieval (IR) can be defined as a software program that deals with the organization, storage, retrieval, and evaluation of information from document repositories, particularly textual information. Information Retrieval is the activity of obtaining material that can usually be documented on an unstructured nature i.e. usually text which satisfies an information need from within large collections which is stored on computers. For example, Information Retrieval can be when a user enters a query into the system.

In this project, I implement various data recovery techniques with all the operational details and try not to use existing modules and implement all functions.
I implement different information retrieval algorithms and you can check the report of how each algorithm works in the [Report Folder](https://github.com/arash-mehrzadi/information-retrieval-engine/blob/main/I_R_E.ipynb)

### ! The functions of the Import Data section are implemented in such a way that you enter all the documents in (.docx) Format into the project by entering the path of your document folder.

### ! This system has no limit on the number or volume of documents

 
# Data 

The processing is currently done on one of my articles and you can use any text and process it as input data.
My Input Data : [Introuducing Basic Concepts of Data Science](https://ceckiau.ir/blog/data-science-concepts/)

# Requirements
You can use one of the following modules to import the text of the documents into the project .

python-docx : python-docx is a Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.

More information is available in the [python-docx documentation.](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

docx2txt : A pure python-based utility to extract text and images from docx files.

More information is available in the [docx2txt documentation.](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This codes is built using Python 3.7.5, and utilizes the following packages : 
- python-docx 0.8.10
- docx2txt 0.8
- pandas 1.1.4
- strings 0.1.2
